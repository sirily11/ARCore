Version 1.34.0 (2022-10-12)
===========================
## Breaking & behavioral changes
None.

## New APIs and capabilities
*  A new ARCore Geospatial API has been added to check for Visual Positioning System (VPS) availability at a specified horizontal position at runtime. This API can be used without an active AR session, for example, to present an "Enter AR" button only when VPS is available. See <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/ios/geospatial/check-vps-availability">Check VPS Availability</a> for more information and a usage example.
  *  [`GARSession.checkVPSAvailabilityAtCoordinate:completionHandler:`](https://developers.google.com/ar/reference/ios/category_g_a_r_session_07_geospatial_08#ab4c2672d3a5f1869663ddb72d1c83189)
*  Geospatial transforms now expose their orientation in 3D space.
  *  [`GARGeospatialTransform.eastUpSouthQTarget`](https://developers.google.com/ar/reference/ios/interface_g_a_r_geospatial_transform#abd5921fc07dca0e1e2c9ce3c1c2e637b)
  *  [`GARSession.geospatialTransformFromTransform:error:`](https://developers.google.com/ar/reference/ios/category_g_a_r_session_07_geospatial_08#a8f34a2bedb4a1b2a41fcbdb9d3358e0c)
  *  [`GARSession.transformFromGeospatialCoordinate:altitude:eastUpSouthQTarget:error:`](https://developers.google.com/ar/reference/ios/category_g_a_r_session_07_geospatial_08#a822bc1ce5bb3c1963568fb6c8cc9207c). Note that Geospatial poses obtained from these functions have a heading value set to zero. Instead, use [`GARGeospatialTransform.eastUpSouthQTarget`](https://developers.google.com/ar/reference/ios/interface_g_a_r_geospatial_transform#abd5921fc07dca0e1e2c9ce3c1c2e637b).

## Deprecations
None.

## Other changes
  * `GARGeospatialTransform` now exposes orientation data in 3D space through [`GARGeospatialTransform.eastUpSouthQTarget`](https://developers.google.com/ar/reference/ios/interface_g_a_r_geospatial_transform#abd5921fc07dca0e1e2c9ce3c1c2e637b). The heading components of a Geospatial transform are now only valid for Geospatial transforms obtained from [`cameraGeospatialTransform`](https://developers.google.com/ar/reference/ios/interface_g_a_r_earth#a59ee0d51e1eeb2b419f2cfe42b91511f); other Geospatial transforms should use the 3D orientation instead.

## Bug fixes
  * Fixed a bug where the Geospatial API would return auth errors when using
    Signed JWT authentication.

Version 1.33.0 (2022-08-18)
===========================
## Breaking & behavioral changes
To use Cloud Anchors, you must now enable the
[ARCore API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/arcore)
instead of the older
[ARCore Cloud Anchor API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/arcorecloudanchor.googleapis.com),
which is now deprecated. To support older app versions, you may enable both
while making the transition. Apps built with ARCore SDK 1.32.0 and lower will
target the older API, while apps built with ARCore SDK 1.33.0 and higher will
target the new API. Note the following:
* The new API uses the domain name `arcore.googleapis.com` instead of
  `arcorecloudanchor.googleapis.com`.
* If you are using Signed JWTs to authenticate, you will need to change the
  `audience` claim to `https://arcore.googleapis.com/` for apps built with
  ARCore SDK 1.33.0 and higher.
* If you are using an API Key which is restricted by API, you must allow the
  ARCore API.
* If you send requests to the ARCore Cloud Anchor Management API from your
  backend, you must also change the domain name to arcore.googleapis.com, after
  enabling the ARCore API.
* The old API/endpoint will continue to be supported through August 2023.
* See [ARCore 1.33 Cloud Anchor endpoint changes](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/cloud-anchors/endpoint-changes) for more details.

## New APIs and capabilities
[ARCore Geospatial Terrain anchor API](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/ios/geospatial/terrain-anchors) creates an anchor at a specified horizontal position and altitude relative to the horizontal positionâ€™s terrain.

*  [`GARAnchor.terrainState`](https://developers.google.com/ar/reference/ios/category_g_a_r_anchor_07_geospatial_08#aa70e610288fc6447167fba1d572004b8)
   Describes the current Terrain anchor state of GARAnchor.
*  [`GARSession.createAnchorWithCoordinate:altitudeAboveTerrain:eastUpSouthQAnchor:error:`](https://developers.google.com/ar/reference/ios/category_g_a_r_session_07_geospatial_08#a5f5941073ee7b5621989d3a692125933)
   Creates a Geospatial Terrain anchor at the specified location, altitude
   above the terrain in meters and orientation relative to the Earth.

## Deprecations
None.

## Other changes
  * Updates for Xcode 14 - see [Xcode 14 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode-Release-Notes/xcode-14-release-notes):
    * SDK binaries no longer contain bitcode, as Apple has deprecated bitcode.
    * SDK binaries no longer contain 32-bit architectures, as Xcode 14 does not
      support these.
    * The SDK no longer supports deployment targets < 11.0, as Xcode 14 does not
      support these.
  * SDK binaries now contain the arm64 simulator architecture for Macs with
    Apple Silicon.
  * SDK binaries are now packaged as XCFrameworks.
  * The SDK now includes Beta support for Swift Package Manager. See README.md
    for how to integrate with ARCore using Swift Package Manager.

Bug fixes and performance improvements.

Version 1.12.0 (2019-09-12)
===========================
  * The ARCore CocoaPod has been divided into two subspecs, `CloudAnchors` and `AugmentedFaces`. `AugmentedFaces` is new for this release. (These libraries are not yet designed to work together.)

  * The `AugmentedFaces` subspec allows you to implement ARCore's Augmented Faces feature on iOS. To read more about Augmented Faces, see https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/ios/augmented-faces/overview

  * The Cloud Anchors feature has changed as follows.
    * The data captured by `hostCloudAnchor:error:` and uploaded to the ARCore Cloud Anchor API service has changed. See https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/ios/cloud-anchors/overview#how-hosted to learn more.
    * `resolveCloudAnchorWithIdentifier:error:` will no longer time out or fail when the ARCore Cloud Anchor API service is unreachable or the anchor cannot be immediately resolved. Instead, the API continues to attempt to resolve the provided anchors until they are removed.
      * The `ErrorResolvingLocalizationNoMatch` and `ErrorServiceUnavailable` enums in `GARCloudAnchorState` are now deprecated and will no longer be returned. For hosted anchors only, the new value `ErrorHostingServiceUnavailable` may be returned.
    * Cloud Anchors is now supported on all ARKit-compatible devices. New devices will be supported immediately with this release.

32-bit architectures, and the README documents three version numbers: minimum
deployment target, minimum base SDK, and minimum version for runtime support.
  * Added support for devices:
    * iPhone: XS, XS Max, XR.
    * iPad Pro: 11 inch, 12.9 inch (3rd gen).

Version 1.5.0 (2018-09-27)
==========================
Added the ability for new devices to be supported without an SDK update.

Resolved Issues:
  * Fixed an issue where ARCore would not compile if used with Firebase Firestore.

Version 1.4.0 (2018-08-02)
==========================
Resolved Issues:
  * Fixed an issue where hosting and resolving Cloud Anchors would fail on iOS 12 with the new 4:3 aspect ratio.
  * Fixed an issue where ARCore would not compile if used with Firebase Messaging.

Version 1.3.0 (2018-06-21)
==========================
Adds support for ARKit-compatible iPads. These include:
  * iPad: 5th and 6th generation
  * iPad Pro: 12.9 inch (1st and 2nd gen), 10.5 inch, 9.7 inch

Resolved Issues:
  * Fixed an issue where an invalid API key for the ARCore Cloud Anchor Service would result in a cloud anchor state of `GARCloudAnchorStateErrorInternal`. The error state will now be `GARCloudAnchorStateErrorNotAuthorized`.

Version 1.2.1 (2018-05-30)
==========================
Resolved Issues:
  * Removed SDK references to `ARFaceAnchor`. The `hostCloudAnchor:` implementation no longer checks that the passed in `ARAnchor` is not an `ARFaceAnchor`, and no longer forcibly exits with `GARSessionErrorCodeAnchorNotSupportedForHosting`. However, use of `ARFaceAnchor`s remains unsupported in this release.

Version 1.2.0 (2018-05-08)
==========================
Initial release alongside ARCore 1.2 on Android.
  * Support for Cloud Anchors.
  * Supported devices: iPhone X, 8, 8+, 7, 7+, 6S, 6S+, SE.

Known Issues:
  * An invalid API key for the ARCore Cloud Anchor Service will result in a Cloud Anchor state of `GARCloudAnchorStateErrorInternal` instead of `GARCloudAnchorStateErrorNotAuthorized`. This is a known issue and will be fixed in an upcoming release.
